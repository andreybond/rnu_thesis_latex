# ISMA BSc Thesis LaTeX Template (XeLaTeX)

This template implements the key layout and styling rules from the provided ISMA guidelines (A4, 12pt, Times New Roman/Calibri, 1.5 line spacing, mirrored margins, outer page numbers, table/figure caption placement, chapter-based numbering, and an alphabetized bibliography).

Detailed LaTeX documentation can be found at [latex-project.org](https://www.latex-project.org/help/documentation/)

## üéØ Workflow Overview for Students

When your **BSc thesis topic** is approved by your supervisor and officially submitted, you are required to:

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you do not already have one).  
   - [Sign up here](https://github.com/join).  

2. **Clone this repository** (the official ISMA thesis template) to your own private GitHub repository.  
   - This will ensure your thesis work is version-controlled and progress is visible.  

3. **Set up LaTeX** on your computer (see installation instructions below).  

4. **Work with the template**:  
   - Edit the `.tex` files to reflect your own thesis contents.  
   - Keep the structure, formatting, and guidelines intact unless your supervisor specifies changes.  

5. **Commit and push changes at least every two weeks**.  
   - This is **mandatory**. Failure to do so will mean your thesis may be **discarded**.  
   - A ‚Äúlast-day full thesis commit‚Äù is not acceptable, as supervisors need to verify that you have been consistently working.  

---

## üö® Mandatory Git Commit Policy

- **Bi-weekly commits are required.**  
- Each commit should represent meaningful progress (e.g., introduction draft, updated figures, conclusions refined).  
- Supervisors will monitor your GitHub repository for activity.  
- **No visible commit history = thesis work cannot be verified = thesis not accepted.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Git & GitHub Setup

### 1. Install Git

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

#### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install git
```

#### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S git
```

#### Windows

Download and install from [git-scm.com](git-scm.com).

During installation, choose ‚ÄúGit from the command line‚Äù option.

#### macOS
```bash
# With Homebrew
brew install git
```
Or install from [git-scm.com](git-scm.com).

### 2. Configure Git (once)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### 3. Clone the Template

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ISMA-university/bsc-thesis-template.git
cd bsc-thesis-template
```

### 4. Create Your Own GitHub Repository

- On [GitHub](https://github.com/), create a new private repository named e.g. bsc-thesis-2025-YourName.
- Link your local project to your private repository:

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/bsc-thesis-2025_YourName.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Basic Git Commands You Will Use

It is assumed that last year BSC students should know how to use de-facto world standart 
code Version Control System (VCS). If not, no worries - it is rather simple, below are the main commands
you will be using (in any full documentation describing all use cases can be found at [https://git-scm.com/doc](https://git-scm.com/doc)):

```bash
# Check file status
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Draft of introduction section"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

Make local commits regularly, ideally each focused result, make pushes of local work progress every 1‚Äì2 weeks minimum, preferably more often.

## üì¶ Installation of LaTeX Environment

You must set up XeLaTeX and dependencies on your system. Instructions per platform:

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex texlive-latex-extra texlive-science
sudo apt-get install python3-pygments texlive-bibtex-extra biber
```

### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install texlive-xetex texlive-latexextra texlive-science
sudo dnf install python3-pygments texlive-biblatex biber
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S texlive-core texlive-latexextra texlive-science
sudo pacman -S python-pygments texlive-bibtexextra biber
```

### Windows

- Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).
- During installation, allow ‚ÄúInstall missing packages on the fly.‚Äù
- Use **MiKTeX Console** to install:
    - `latex-extra`, `science` and `biber` dependencies.
- Install Python from [python.org](python.org) and then:

```bash
pip install pygments
```

### macOS

#### Option 1: BasicTeX (lightweight)

```bash
brew install basictex
sudo tlmgr update --self
sudo tlmgr install collection-latexextra collection-science biber minted xetex
brew install python
pip3 install pygments
```

#### Option 2: Full MacTeX (recommended if you have space)
- Download from [tug.org/mactex](tug.org/mactex)

## üìñ Compilation Instructions

To compile your thesis to PDF:
```bash
xelatex main
biber main
xelatex main
xelatex main
```

You might wonder why multiple 'xelatex' runs are needed - thats for references and cross-links.


## üìù Notes for Students

- Always start your thesis work by pulling the latest template updates (if any).
- Keep a clean commit history (avoid uploading temporary files).
- Use `.gitignore` (already included) to avoid committing unnecessary build files.
- If you face issues with LaTeX compilation, consult your supervisor or the provided troubleshooting section.
- Use English or Latvian consistently for your thesis, unless instructed otherwise.

## üí° Editor Suggestions

- VS Code with LaTeX Workshop plugin (recommended).
- TeXStudio (free, user-friendly).
- Overleaf (online, if local setup fails).

In regards to feedback - you can:
- give direct feedback, plain text in email;
- Issue tracking - you can create issues in the repository (but student have to give you writing permissions), still your will have to refer to the places in text;
- PullRequests - most advanced but allow to review each commits series and comment on a specic places of edited files.

## üìä Highlights (Template Features)

- A4, mirrored margins.
- Times New Roman 12pt font (default).
- 1.5 line spacing.
- Figures below, tables above captions.
- Chapter-based numbering (e.g., Table 2.3).
- BibLaTeX + Biber for bibliography.
- Multilingual support (EN/LV/RU).
- Appendices & examples included.

## üöÄ Final Checklist Before Submission

1. Thesis structure complete (Introduction ‚Üí Chapters ‚Üí Conclusions ‚Üí References ‚Üí Appendices).
2. Commit history visible, with at least bi-weekly progress updates.
3. PDF compiles without errors.
4. Supervisor has approved your contents and structure.
5. Keywords, abstract, and title page filled correctly in both English and Latvian.

Happy writing, and remember: commit often, commit meaningfully (mind commit messages!), and push to GitHub regularly!
