\unchapter{Abstract}

The abstract is a short summary of the Bachelor Paper. It should give the reader a clear overview of the topic, the structure of the thesis, the methods applied, and the main findings. The abstract must not exceed 300 words and must be written as one continuous text (no bullet points, tables, figures, or references).  

The abstract typically begins with a \textbf{brief introduction to the topic}. State in 1–2 sentences what the paper is about and why the topic is relevant. Do not repeat the full aim, tasks, or hypothesis here – these are covered in the Introduction.  

Next, provide a \textbf{chapter-by-chapter overview of the structure of the thesis}.  
Example:  
"The Bachelor Paper consists of <NUMBER OF CHAPTERS>. Chapter 1 reviews <THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK>. Chapter 2 presents <ANALYSIS OF FIELD/CASE/STUDY OBJECT>. Chapter 3 contains <EMPIRICAL STUDY OR PRACTICAL RESEARCH>. Chapter 4 proposes <IMPROVEMENTS / MODEL / SOLUTIONS>."  

Afterwards, include a short note on the \textbf{methods applied}, without going into detail.  
Example:  
"The methodological basis of the study includes the analysis of scientific literature, statistical data, and other relevant sources. The applied methods are <LIST METHODS SUCH AS: comparative analysis, surveys, experiments, modelling>."  

Then, summarize the \textbf{main results and conclusions} in 2–3 sentences. Focus only on the most important contribution of the paper.  

Finally, indicate the \textbf{scope of the work}.
